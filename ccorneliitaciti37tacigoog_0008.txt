PREFACE.

νει-φῇ.-

Tne parts ol Tacitus contained in this volume,
are printed from the text of Valpy, as it is found
in his edition of the Delphin and Variorum Clas·
sics. It is the textos Oberlin‚ witha different
orthography ol some werde, and witha few
changes in the punctuation. The sew notes at
the end of the volume are mostly extracted from
different authore, and are given as they werefound,
Ι with little variation ol language. To refer each
, note to the commentator from whom it was taken,

was thought unnecessary in a work of this kind.

In. this third edition, some improvements have

been made. J. L. K.
Yann Contineo, June 15, 1841.
