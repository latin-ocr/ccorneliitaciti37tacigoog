ilaris] Camden supposes the Shetland islands to be meant here by
Thule ς others imagine it tc have been 000 01 the Hebrides.

Sed mure pigmen] As sar as the meaning os this passage can be eluci·
dated, it would appear as is the iirst circumnavigators of Britain, to en·
hance the idea os their dangers and hardships, had represented tha northern
sea as in such a thiokened, hals solid state, that the oars could scarcely lie
worked, or the waters agitated by the winds. Tacitus, however, rather
chooses to explain its stagnant condition from the want 01 winds, aud the
difficulty 01 moting so great a body 01 water. But the sact, taken either
way, is erroneous, as this sea is never ohserved srozen, and is remarkably
stormy and tempestuous.

Nec littore unos] ‘The ebbings and flowings 01 the tide are not confined
to the shore, but the sea penetrates into the heart 01 the country, aud works

the extreme and ilat parts 01 the earth casting a low shudow, do not elevate
the darkness, and night falls beneath the sky aud the stara? This explana-
tion scems to be grounded on the suppositioni, that the darkness os night is
nothing more than the shadow os hills and mountains.

Gignit et Oceanus magarito] ‘The ocean also produces pearls, but 01 a
cloudy and livid hue, which some impute to unskillfuluess in the gutherers3
scrin the Red Sea, the fish are plucked from the rocks alive and vigorous3
but iu Britain they are collected as the seathrows them up. For my own
part Ι can more readily conceive that the desset isin the nature oi the pearls,
